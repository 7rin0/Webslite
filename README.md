# Webslite - Convert sites into slides
This small extension was created to learn about Chrome Extensions architecture and as "exercise" i decide to create an extension able to extract images and their information to allow a quick read/overview about news, events, etc ... 

## Requirements
- Chrome >= 18

## Installation
- git clone https://github.com/7rin0/Webslite.git
- go to chrome://extensions
- Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked
- Load unpacked extension, navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it

## Enjoy!
